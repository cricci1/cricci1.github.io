      <h1><u>About Me</u></h1>
      &nbsp;
      <p>Hello, World! My name is Christian and I am a third year student studying Software Development at Seneca Polytechnic.</h3>
      &nbsp;
      <p> I started my programming journey at the beginning of high school after being fascinated about what happens behind the scenes of my favorite video games.
           My teacher at the time let us code with <b>Turing</b> and eventually taught us <b>Java</b> and <b>Python</b> in my senior years. The whole time I was very engaged and it ended up being one of my top classes in each semester.
           I knew at that point that I wanted to pursue programming as a full time job since creating things with code brought me a lot of joy. 
           To this day, I'm continuing to learn more about programming and strengthening my current skills in order to become the best programmer that I can possibly be. 
      </p>
      &nbsp;
      <p> Outside of the code, I enjoy watching many different types of TV Shows and Movies. Some of my favorites are <b>Breaking Bad</b>, <b>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</b> and <b>Cyberpunk: Edgerunners</b>. 
          I also enjoy listening to different types of music. My current favorite genres are <b>Rap</b> and <b>EDM</b> and my favorite artist is <b>Porter Robinson</b>. One of my favorite albums from his has to be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijmUdI_c-fk&list=PLAZNU5fM7FIC4ruXQhKjpuvP0AByhc0bl">Nurture</a> which came out in 2021 and has been
          on repeat ever since. I would highly suggest listening to it if you ever get the chance!
      </p>
      &nbsp;
      <p>Thank you for stopping by and learning a little bit about me!</h3>
